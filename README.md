# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System
Project Description

The Local Food Wastage Management System is a Python-based web application that helps reduce food wastage by connecting food providers (restaurants, hotels, households) with receivers (NGOs, needy individuals).
The system enables users to list surplus food, manage availability, and track claims in real-time.
It also provides data analytics and visualizations to monitor donations and claim trends.

This project was developed using Streamlit for the web interface, SQLite for the database, and ngrok to make the application accessible online from Google Colab.
